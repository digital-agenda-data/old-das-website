                        This bar-chart allows you to select one indicator, one year, and see which countries are leading the league. You can also check if the ranking of countries has changed over the last few years. Countries are always ordered according to their score. You can also select or de-select countries in order to visualise only those you are interested in.

                        To assess progress and estimate future developments it is essential to know where we come from. Time-line charts allow you to visualise this kind of trends for one country and to compare it with some others, as well as with the European average trend.

                        Scatter-plot is a kind of chart that compares two indicators, represented on the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axis. Each country appears as a point whose coordinates are its values on the two selected indicators.

                        This chart presents the values of a country for a group of indicators (or all of them), and compares them with the European average. It allows to see if  a country is performing above/under EU average and more or less near to the maximum/minimum observed values. The chart is complemented by a table detailing values for each country according to the quartile they belong to.
